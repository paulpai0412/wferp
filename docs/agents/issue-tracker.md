# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and PRDs for this repo live as GitHub issues:

- Repository: `paulpai0412/wferp`
- URL: <https://github.com/paulpai0412/wferp>
- Source skill setup: <https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/tree/main/skills/engineering/setup-matt-pocock-skills>

Use the `gh` CLI for issue operations when a skill says to publish to or fetch from the issue tracker.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --repo paulpai0412/wferp --title "..." --body "..."`. Use a heredoc for multi-line bodies.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --repo paulpai0412/wferp --comments`, filtering comments by `jq` and also fetching labels when needed.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --repo paulpai0412/wferp --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], comments: [.comments[].body]}]'` with appropriate `--label` and `--state` filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --repo paulpai0412/wferp --body "..."`.
- **Apply / remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --repo paulpai0412/wferp --add-label "..."` / `--remove-label "..."`.
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number> --repo paulpai0412/wferp --comment "..."`.

When running inside this clone, `gh` can also infer the repository from `git remote -v`.

## Autonomous workflow tracker rules

- PR bodies and issue comments may summarize verification only by referencing a verifier-owned evidence packet, for example `docs/agents/evidence/issue-<issue>-pr-<pr>.yaml`.
- Do not paste raw test logs, browser traces, SQL execution logs, or verbose manual QA transcripts into issue comments or PR bodies.
- A final QA statement must identify the verifier packet and must not be written as a direct main-agent QA claim.
- If no verifier packet exists, the issue or PR must be marked blocked for missing verification evidence instead of reporting tests or QA as passed.
- Worker self-check summaries may be mentioned only as implementation feedback; they are not acceptance evidence unless independently confirmed by a verifier packet.
- `verifier_read_worker_result_only: false` is allowed when the verifier also reads compact refs such as the issue packet, PR diff, checkpoint, or PR page; it must not import full worker transcripts or raw logs.
- Artifact bodies must stay compact: issue packets <=80 lines, handoffs <=35 lines, evidence packets <=60 lines, checkpoints <=80 lines, and worker results <=80 lines.
- Raw evidence is index-only in repo docs and main-agent context; keep full logs/traces/screenshots in external artifact bundles referenced by manifest IDs.
- A `release_worker` may merge and close only after a verifier-owned evidence packet passes, the PR is mergeable, required checks pass, and human merge approval policy is satisfied; otherwise it must report blocked.
- Default merge approval mode is `human_required`.
- Autonomous workflow start may explicitly set `approval_override_mode: bypass_approval` for that workflow run only.
- `bypass_approval` may bypass only `human_merge_approval_policy_satisfied`; it must not bypass verifier pass, required checks, PR mergeability, review gate, diagnostics/build gate, or surface QA gate.
- `bypass_approval` must be declared at workflow start, recorded in the runtime checkpoint, remain immutable after start, and apply only to PRs created by that workflow run.
- Release summaries or PR comments for bypassed merges must record `merge_approval_mode`, `human_approval_skipped`, `override_source`, and `override_scope`.
- After a `release_worker` merge succeeds, it must run post-merge workspace hygiene before closing the linked issue.
- Post-merge workspace hygiene may modify only workspace hygiene state: preserve dirty primary workspace state, switch the primary workspace back to `main`, fast-forward `main`, and remove a clean merged issue worktree when safe.
- If the primary workspace is dirty, the `release_worker` should preserve it with a WIP branch named `agent/wip/post-merge-issue-{issue_number}-{yyyyMMdd-HHmm}` and a stash message `post-merge hygiene preserve issue-{issue_number} from {source_branch}` before restoring `main`.
- If post-merge workspace hygiene fails, the linked issue must remain open and the tracker comment must report a compact hygiene summary instead of claiming issue closure.
- Post-merge workspace hygiene summaries must use fixed fields in both repo-local checkpoint state and GitHub comments: `primary_workspace_branch_before`, `primary_workspace_branch_after`, `dirty_state_detected`, `wip_branch_created`, `stash_created`, `workspace_clean_after`, `issue_worktree_removed`, `cleanup_status`, and `blocked_reason`.
- `blocked_reason` values for hygiene failures should use fixed enums: `dirty_workspace_preserve_failed`, `switch_main_failed`, `fast_forward_main_failed`, `worktree_remove_failed`, `workspace_not_clean_after_cleanup`, and `issue_worktree_dirty_blocked`.
- Do not use `ultrawork` or any continuous autonomous loop to select and implement multiple `ready-for-agent` AFK issues concurrently from one orchestrator path.
- Until a dedicated concurrency policy exists, issue execution remains serial: one selected issue, one branch, one fresh worker session, one verifier session, and one PR at a time.

### Post-merge workspace hygiene comment template

Use this compact GitHub comment shape after `release_worker` merge-time cleanup completes or blocks:

```md
## Post-merge workspace hygiene
- primary_workspace_branch_before: <branch>
- primary_workspace_branch_after: <branch>
- dirty_state_detected: <true|false>
- wip_branch_created: <none-or-branch-name>
- stash_created: <none-or-stash-ref>
- workspace_clean_after: <true|false>
- issue_worktree_removed: <true|false|blocked>
- cleanup_status: <pass|blocked>
- blocked_reason: <none|dirty_workspace_preserve_failed|switch_main_failed|fast_forward_main_failed|worktree_remove_failed|workspace_not_clean_after_cleanup|issue_worktree_dirty_blocked>
```

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"
